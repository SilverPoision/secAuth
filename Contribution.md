# Contribution

I love your input! I want you to make contribution to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use Github pull request, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SilverPoision/secAuth/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
